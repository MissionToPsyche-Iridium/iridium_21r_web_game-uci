Yuno (Sad):  Aww, you’re leaving? That sucks…[pause=1]It was really nice getting to know you. I’m going to miss you a lot. 
Yuno (Happy): Don’t worry, I’ll be okay. Before you go, I’d like to give you a gift. I saw how much you have been studying the metals, so I think you would get a kick out of this tool. Make sure to tell me or Zimbo how it is. We love to hear back from you!
Yuno: Thanks for everything friend, I hope you have a safe ride home!
