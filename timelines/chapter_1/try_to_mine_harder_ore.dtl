This rock won't budge...
characters/Claire (Sad): It looks like that rock's made of some pretty hard material. I don't think you'll be able to chip at it with that pickaxe.
if {has_met_zimbo} == true:
	characters/Claire (Neutral): Zimbo might be able to make your pickaxe strong enough to mine it. You should go talk to him!
else:
	Why wasn't I equipped with something that COULD chip at it?
	characters/Claire (Angry): Hey! Do you know how much it cost us to send you up there? These missions aren't cheap, you know!
