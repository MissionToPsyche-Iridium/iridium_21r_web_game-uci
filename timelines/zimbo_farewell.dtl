Zimbo (Sad): You’re leaving so soon? Aw…[pause=1]I thought we had more time together.
Zimbo (Happy):  It’s been nice meeting you and I am so glad I got to be friend with you. I never knew I would make a new friend here. 
Zimbo (Neutral):  Oh![pause=1] Before I forget, I want you to have this. It’s a special communication tool I made so you can contact us here whenever you want. Take care friend, I hope to see you again soon!
